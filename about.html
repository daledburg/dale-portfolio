                    <h3>Why Change Now?</h3>
                    <p class="about-me-para">My name is Dale Dahlenburg and I'm determined to be a full stack web developer of the future. I am currently 27 years old and the idea of a career in the tech industry was never something I thought could be a possibility. After 10 years out of school pursuing various studies and careers, I finally stumbled upon the possibility of a career that truly interested me and I could see myself thriving in. After discovering the concept of bootcamps I researched many different providers and came to the amazing decision of enrolling with Coder Academy. The rest will be history. </p>
                    <h3>Previous Experience</h3>
                    <p class="about-me-para">I have worked in a multitude of different industry's during my time in the workforce, mainly focused on customer service roles. One of my most prominent jobs was as a Croupier at the Townsville casino 'The Ville' which while enjoyable did not provide enough mental stimulation.</p>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <div class="hobbies-container"><p class="about-me-para1">Taking up most of my time is my two dogs, Layla and Ruby. I now realise just how true the saying 'Man's best friend' is and they add so much joy to my life. I am also a mad sports fan and could watch nearly any sport as the competition really excites me. Have any crazy sports 'takes'? I'm sure we could have a lively discussion. </p><div class="cricket-div"><img id="cricket" src="images/cricket-pic.jpg" alt="Cricket image"></div></div>
